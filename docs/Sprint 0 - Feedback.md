## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- Your system description/overview makes sense. You will have to reformat this a little bit for the Rhodes Symposium (as a single paragraph), but the basic idea is there.
- Good list of core functionaltiies. You have fleshed out some of these details nicely from the earlier concept. I will ask you more about your plans for the similarity detection algorithm in class.
- Good architectural overview. System components all make sense. All of them are included in the system diagram. My only suggestion would be to flip your diagram around so that the front- end is on the left, and show a user icon to indicate the users' external touchpoint with system.
- Your epics are generally good. However, 'API Connections' is not an epic or user story. It is an implementation detail that will translate into multiple tasks. You need to figure out what features will be exposed from those APIs and characterize them as something user facing.
- Great non- functional requirements.
- Great list of technologies and frameworks. It looks very reasonable and well thought out.
- Your MVP is very detailed, which is wonderful. Having a summarizing paragraph would have been a plus. How would you explain your MVP to a non- technical person in 2- 3 sentences?
- Your roadmap is a good start. Adding references to user stories would have been beneficial. When you mention a page being implemented, finished, continued, etc. it is underspecified in terms of the focus for that sprint. What part/feature from the page are you targetting?
- Overall great job on your plan!

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- User stories look great.
- Titles are consistently formatted.
- All stories are traceable to epics.
- You have a very good start on your acceptance criteria. Some stories still need ACs defined, but that's not a big deal. They can be added before review.
- All stories have estimates of level of effort, which is great.
- Prioritization looks good and consistent with your roadmap.
- Great job!
